        <h2 class="story-h2">Her POV</h2>
        <div class="para-container para-separetor">
            <p class="para">Both of us had recently relocated to Oregon for work and happened to attend the same church. Typically, I would leave church immediately after the service, in a rush to get back home for various reasons. However, things took a turn when, after a few months, I was appointed as the leader for the Singles' choir, necessitating a bit more interaction. It was during my recruitment efforts for the Singles choir that Sola and I connected.</p>
            <p class="para">Approaching him with an invitation to join the choir, I handed him my number, and told him to expect to hear from me. He claims we had crossed paths before (though I genuinely couldn't recall), and he had been trying to muster the courage to ask for my number. Look at God!... LOL. Anyways, the Singles choir never materialized as the lockdown commenced shortly after but we maintained communication. I noticed his attempts to establish a connection beyond that of a potential choir member, so my guards went straight up. In fact, I blocked every access he had previously and declined every visitation request. Although, we still maintained group interactions.</p>
            <p class="para">Fast forward about a year later, he decided to revisit the issue, expressing his intentions clearly. Ofcourse, I requested time to pray about it and also asked him to submit an application letter to my email, outlining his value proposition... LOL again!</p>
            <p class="para">Here we are today. God gets all the glory.</p>

        <h2 class="story-h3">His POV</h2>
        <div class="para-container">
            <p class="para">In the latter part of the summer in 2019, I relocated  from Georgia to Oregon. As a newcomer to the city, I was on the lookout for a faith-based community, and that's when I discovered RCCG. Joining the media team, I was struck by her entrance into the media room one day—her beauty left me in awe. It wasn't long before a mutual friend introduced us in the church's car park as we headed to our respective cars. We exchanged pleasantries and went our separate ways.</p>
            <p class="para">A few weeks later, Kemi took on the leadership role in the Singles’ choir, providing the perfect opportunity for us to exchange numbers and begin our journey. Shortly after she assumed leadership, the pandemic forced a shift to the virtual world. Fortunately, we had each other's contacts, and I started noticing her WhatsApp status. I couldn't resist commenting on her beauty—truth be told (lol). Our conversations evolved beyond the confines of the singles' choir topic, blossoming into a camaraderie.</p>
            <p class="para">At times, it seemed challenging to reach her, but my love for her persisted. What started as a casual acquaintance transformed into a deep love, rooted in shared moments and laughter. Eventually, I asked her to be my partner, and after some time, particularly during one of our group trips, she said yes! A few months later, with the assistance of her closest friends, I orchestrated a surprise proposal. I am grateful for God's faithfulness and feel blessed to do life with my beautiful baby girl 💗</p>
